# Decision Framework: Web UI Integration

This document provides a structured framework for deciding when (and whether) to proceed with web UI integration as described in [06-web-ui-integration.md](../06-web-ui-integration.md). The framework is trigger-based: implementation should be initiated by concrete conditions being met, not by a predetermined schedule.

---

## 1. Decision Principle

Web UI integration provides an **accessible front door** for audiences who will never navigate GitHub's developer-centric interface. The web surface and GitHub Issues serve different audiences: developers interact through Issues; everyone else — evaluators, stakeholders, managers — accesses the project through the web surface. These surfaces are complementary, not competing.

**Rule:** Implement the session viewer when the curation prerequisites are met. The decision is driven by readiness (safe content to publish), not by demand (waiting for adoption requests). Accessibility should be proactive, not reactive — by the time someone asks "can I see what the agent does?", the answer should already exist.

---

## 2. Scope: Two Independent Decisions

The source document proposes two use cases that should be evaluated independently:

| Use Case | Decision Type | Reversibility |
|---|---|---|
| Interactive demo | Reversibility-neutral (can be removed without data loss) | High |
| Session viewer | Reversibility-neutral (can be removed; sessions remain in Git) | High |

Both use cases are individually reversible — deleting the HTML files and build step removes the feature cleanly. However, once published, external links to session viewer pages create a soft dependency that discourages removal.

## 3. Trigger Events: Session Viewer

### 3.1 Prerequisites (All Must Be Met)

These are not triggers — they are preconditions. The session viewer should not be considered until all are satisfied:

| ID | Prerequisite | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| P-01 | At least 3 representative sessions exist that are safe for public consumption | Sessions reviewed for sensitive content; no API keys, credentials, or PII |
| P-02 | A content redaction process is documented | Written procedure for reviewing and sanitising session transcripts |
| P-03 | public-fabric is stable and actively maintained | index.html and status.json are current; GitPages deployment is reliable |

Note: Feature completeness (P1/P2 from [implementation-plan.md](../implementation-plan.md)) is no longer a prerequisite. The session viewer's value — making the agent legible to non-developer audiences — is independent of which features the agent supports. Early-stage sessions demonstrating basic reasoning and tool use are valuable in their own right.

### 3.2 Soft Triggers (Evaluate Implementation)

Once all prerequisites are met, the following events should prompt an implementation evaluation:

| ID | Trigger | Evidence Required |
|---|---|---|
| T-01 | Prospective adopters ask "can I see what the agent does?" | Three or more requests for a demo or example session |
| T-02 | External documentation or blog posts need to link to example interactions | A concrete need for a stable URL showing agent behaviour |
| T-03 | Governance review requires published evidence of agent behaviour | An audit, compliance check, or stakeholder review that needs visible session data |
| T-04 | The project's public visibility increases to a point where the status page alone is insufficient | GitHub stars, forks, or inbound traffic suggest broader interest |

### 3.3 Non-Triggers (Do Not Implement For These Reasons Alone)

These conditions, on their own, do not justify implementation:

| Condition | Why It Is Not a Trigger |
|---|---|
| "pi-web-ui has nice components" | Available tooling is not a reason to build features |
| "Other projects have chat demos" | Competitive comparison does not override substance |
| "Sessions are already in Git; why not publish them?" | Availability of data does not mean it should be published without curation |

Note: Some items previously listed as non-triggers have been reclassified. "The page looks empty without a demo" is a legitimate UX concern when the audience includes non-developers who form impressions quickly. "We should show off the agent" is a valid impulse when the alternative is that no one outside programmerville can see what the agent does.

---

## 4. Trigger Events: Interactive Demo

### 4.1 Hard Prerequisite

The interactive demo should not be implemented unless the Experience Gap Problem (see [analysis.md §3.2](analysis.md)) is resolved. Resolution requires one of:

| ID | Resolution Path | Feasibility |
|---|---|---|
| R-01 | Browser-based agent gains access to repository tools (bash, read, write) | Very Low — requires a backend or WebContainer runtime |
| R-02 | A sandbox repository is created for the demo with pre-loaded content | Medium — reduces experience gap but still differs from real usage |
| R-03 | The demo is replaced by a guided replay of a real session | High — no live LLM needed; accurate representation |

Without R-01, R-02, or R-03, the interactive demo will misrepresent the product. Misrepresentation is worse than having no demo.

### 4.2 Additional Prerequisites

Even if the experience gap is resolved:

| ID | Prerequisite | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| D-01 | A funding model exists for API costs (if using a shared key) | Budget allocated; cost monitoring in place |
| D-02 | Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse | Per-session token limits; per-IP cooldown |
| D-03 | The demo is clearly labelled as a limited preview, not the full experience | UI copy explicitly states: "This demo does not represent the full agent experience. See GitHub Issues for the complete interaction model." |

### 4.3 Current Recommendation

**Do not implement the interactive demo.** None of the resolution paths (R-01 through R-03) have been pursued, and the experience gap remains unresolved. If a demonstration is needed, pursue R-03 (guided replay) as an alternative — it requires no API key, no backend, and accurately represents the agent's capabilities.

---

## 5. Implementation Evaluation Process

When a trigger event occurs, follow this process:

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Check all prerequisites in §3.1 (for session viewer) or §4.1–4.2 (for interactive demo). If any prerequisite is unmet, defer implementation until it is satisfied.

### Step 2: Assess Value Against Cost

| Factor | Session Viewer | Interactive Demo |
|---|---|---|
| Estimated implementation effort | 4–8 hours | 8–16 hours |
| Ongoing curation effort | 1–2 hours per published session | API cost monitoring; abuse prevention |
| Value to prospective adopters | High (shows real capabilities) | Low-Medium (limited capabilities) |
| Alignment with architecture | Medium | Low |

### Step 3: Choose Implementation Approach

For the session viewer:

| Approach | When to Choose |
|---|---|
| Vanilla JS | Start here. Sufficient for text rendering, basic code blocks, and message threading |
| pi-web-ui | Upgrade when vanilla JS cannot handle tool call visualisation, session tree navigation, or artifact display |
| Jekyll integration | Consider if the session viewer should be part of a broader Jekyll-powered documentation site (see [github-jekyll-pages.md](../../github-jekyll-pages.md)) |

For the interactive demo:

| Approach | When to Choose |
|---|---|
| Guided replay | Preferred approach. Pre-recorded session plays back in the browser |
| Live demo with user API key | Only if R-01 or R-02 is resolved and the experience gap is addressed |
| Sandbox repository demo | If a dedicated demo repository with pre-loaded content is available |

### Step 4: Implement Incrementally

1. Build the minimum viable version (one curated session, vanilla JS renderer)
2. Deploy to a sub-path of public-fabric (e.g., `public-fabric/sessions/`)
3. Do not link from the main page until the rendering quality is validated
4. Collect feedback from 3+ external viewers before expanding

### Step 5: Evaluate After 30 Days

After 30 days of deployment:

| Signal | Interpretation | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Sessions are being viewed (measurable via GitHub Pages analytics) | Value is being delivered | Continue; expand curated session library |
| No measurable traffic | Value is not being consumed | Evaluate whether the sessions are linked, discoverable, or interesting |
| Sensitive content incident | Curation process failed | Pause publishing; review and improve redaction process |
| pi-web-ui update breaks rendering | Dependency risk materialised | Revert to vanilla JS; reassess dependency |

## 6. Decision Record Template

When a decision is made (implement or defer), record it in this format:

```markdown
### Decision: [Session Viewer / Interactive Demo]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Trigger:** [Which trigger event occurred]
**Prerequisites met:** [List P-01 through P-05 status]
**Decision:** [Implement / Defer / Reject]
**Rationale:** [Brief explanation]
**Approach:** [Vanilla JS / pi-web-ui / Guided replay / Other]
**Review date:** [30 days from implementation, or next trigger event]
```

---

## 7. Current Status

As of 2026-03-30:

- **Prerequisite P-01** is not met. No sessions have been reviewed for public consumption.
- **Prerequisite P-02** is not met. No content redaction process exists.
- **Prerequisite P-03** is met. public-fabric is stable and deployed.
- **Recommendation:** Establish a content curation and redaction process (P-02), then identify and review 3+ sessions for publication (P-01). Once both are met, implement the session viewer using vanilla JS. Feature completeness is no longer a blocker — the session viewer's accessibility value is independent of the agent's feature maturity.

---

## 8. Summary

The web UI integration decision should be driven by readiness to publish safe content, not by waiting for feature completeness or external demand. Making GitHub's developer-centric complexity disappear for non-developer audiences is an accessibility imperative, not a nice-to-have. The session viewer has a clear path to implementation with three prerequisites — curated sessions, a documented redaction process, and a stable public-fabric deployment. The interactive demo should not be implemented until the experience gap problem is resolved, with guided replay (R-03) as the recommended alternative. Both decisions are independently reversible, which lowers the stakes but does not eliminate the ongoing curation cost once deployed.

*Framework derived from the analysis in [analysis.md](analysis.md) and [risk-matrix.md](risk-matrix.md). Revised to reflect the accessibility imperative: proactive implementation when content prerequisites are met, rather than reactive implementation when demand is demonstrated. Applies to GMI's public-fabric as of 2026-03-30.*
