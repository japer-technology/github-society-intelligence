# Implementation: Web UI Integration

This document details the implementation plan for evaluating and potentially integrating `@earendil-works/pi-web-ui` into the GSI public-fabric, as identified in the [implementation plan](implementation-plan.md).

A guiding principle: **a UX that makes GitHub's developer-centric complexity disappear is a good thing.** GitHub Issues are the right interface for developers interacting with the agent. But for everyone else — evaluators, stakeholders, managers, prospective adopters — a web surface that presents the agent's work without requiring GitHub literacy is an accessibility imperative, not an architectural concession.

## 1. Current State

### 1.1 Public-Fabric Architecture

GSI's public-facing website is a static page deployed to GitHub Pages:

```
.github-society-intelligence/public-fabric/
├── index.html        # Single-page renderer
└── status.json       # Content data (sections, badges, links)
```

The page displays project status, feature descriptions, and documentation links. It is purely informational — there is no interactive chat or AI functionality.

### 1.2 pi-web-ui Package

`@earendil-works/pi-web-ui` provides web components for AI chat interfaces:

- Pre-built chat UI with session management
- Support for sessions, artifacts, and attachments
- IndexedDB-backed storage for browser-based persistence
- Compatible with pi's JSONL event format
- No backend required — can connect directly to LLM APIs from the browser

---

## 2. Use Case Evaluation

### 2.1 Interactive Demo Page

**Concept:** Add an interactive chat interface to public-fabric where visitors can talk to the GSI agent directly in their browser, without needing to create a GitHub issue.

**Architecture:**

```
Browser
  └─ pi-web-ui components
       └─ Direct LLM API call (using visitor's API key)
            └─ Model responds with pi agent capabilities
```

**Pros:**
- Zero backend infrastructure — aligns with "GitHub as Infrastructure" principle
- Demonstrates pi agent capabilities interactively
- Could load the same `.pi/` configuration as the GitHub Actions agent

**Cons:**
- Requires the visitor to provide their own API key (or a shared key, which creates cost/security concerns)
- Browser-based agent has no access to the repository (no `bash`, `read`, `write` tools)
- Session state lives in IndexedDB (browser-local), not in Git
- Significantly different from the actual GitHub Issues experience

### 2.2 Session Viewer

**Concept:** Use pi-web-ui to render past agent sessions (stored as JSONL in `state/sessions/`) as readable chat transcripts on the public-fabric website.

**Architecture:**

```
GitHub Actions
  └─ Agent runs, produces state/sessions/*.jsonl
       └─ Build step converts JSONL to static HTML via pi-web-ui
            └─ Published to GitHub Pages
```

**Pros:**
- Shows real agent interactions with full context
- No API key required (read-only)
- Demonstrates actual agent capabilities

**Cons:**
- Session transcripts may contain sensitive information (issue contents, code diffs)
- Additional build step required
- Session files can be large (hundreds of KB per conversation)

### 2.3 Assessment

| Use Case | Feasibility | Value | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Interactive demo | Medium | Medium | Defer — API key requirement replaces one accessibility barrier with another |
| Session viewer | High | High | Implement — makes programmerville disappear for non-developer audiences |
| Chat interface replacement | Low | Low | Not recommended — GitHub Issues is the right interface for developers |

---

## 3. Implementation Approach (Session Viewer)

If the session viewer use case is pursued:

### Step 1: Evaluate pi-web-ui Components

```bash
npm install @earendil-works/pi-web-ui
```

Review the package's exported components:

- Chat message rendering
- Session tree navigation
- Tool call display
- Code block rendering

### Step 2: Build a Session Converter

Create a build script that:

1. Reads selected JSONL session files from `state/sessions/`
2. Filters out sensitive content (if any)
3. Renders to static HTML using pi-web-ui components
4. Outputs to `public-fabric/sessions/`

### Step 3: Integrate with GitHub Pages Deployment

Update the workflow's `run-gitpages` job to include the session HTML files:

```diff
 - name: Upload GitHub Pages artifact
   uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4
   with:
     path: .github-society-intelligence/public-fabric
```

### Step 4: Add Navigation

Update `public-fabric/index.html` or `status.json` to link to the session viewer pages.

---

## 4. Alternative: Lightweight Session Viewer Without pi-web-ui

Instead of pulling in the full pi-web-ui package, a simpler approach:

1. Create a `session-viewer.html` page in public-fabric
2. Use vanilla JavaScript to parse JSONL and render messages
3. Load session data from a static JSON file generated during the build step

This avoids a new dependency and keeps the public-fabric minimal.

```html
<!-- session-viewer.html (simplified) -->
<script>
  fetch("sessions/curated.json")
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(messages => {
      messages.forEach(msg => {
        const el = document.createElement("div");
        el.className = `message ${msg.role}`;
        el.textContent = msg.text;
        document.getElementById("chat").appendChild(el);
      });
    });
</script>
```

## 5. Decision Matrix

| Factor | pi-web-ui | Vanilla JS |
|---|---|---|
| Rich rendering (code blocks, tool calls) | ✅ | ❌ (manual) |
| Session tree navigation | ✅ | ❌ |
| Dependency weight | ~50–100 KB | 0 |
| Maintenance burden | Track pi-web-ui updates | Self-maintained |
| Alignment with "minimal infrastructure" | Medium | High |

**Recommendation:** Start with the vanilla JS approach for a proof of concept. Migrate to pi-web-ui only if the rendering requirements exceed what vanilla JS can reasonably provide.

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Session data contains sensitive information | High | High | Curate sessions manually; never auto-publish |
| pi-web-ui API changes | Medium | Medium | Pin version; test before upgrading |
| Increased build complexity | Medium | Low | Keep as optional build step; don't block deployment |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Low | pi-web-ui uses modern web standards |

---

## 7. Prerequisites

1. **Session curation process** — Define which sessions are safe to publish
2. **Sensitive content filter** — Build tooling to redact API keys, personal information, or proprietary code from session transcripts
3. **Build step** — Create a script to convert JSONL to publishable format

---

## 8. Summary

The pi-web-ui package offers rich chat rendering components that could enhance public-fabric with an interactive demo or session viewer. The interactive demo requires visitors to provide API keys — replacing GitHub's developer-literacy barrier with an API-key barrier — and is not recommended. The session viewer is the clear winner: it makes the agent's work legible to non-developer audiences without requiring a GitHub account, repository access, or API key. It should be implemented when a content curation process is established and representative sessions are available.

The recommended approach is to start with a lightweight vanilla JS session viewer for curated transcripts and evaluate pi-web-ui for upgrade if richer rendering is needed. Making GitHub's "programmerville" disappear for evaluators and stakeholders is an accessibility imperative, and the session viewer is the lowest-cost, highest-value way to achieve it.

*Estimated effort: 4–8 hours (session viewer with vanilla JS), 8–16 hours (with pi-web-ui integration). Risk: Medium (mitigable through content curation). Priority: P2 — implement when curation prerequisites are met.*
