# Authority Registry

The authority registry defines which agencies hold which authority levels and what each level permits them to do.

Authority levels are defined in the [constitution](constitution.md).

## Authority escalation

An agency may not escalate its own authority level.

Authority escalation requires:
1. A proposal from the agency or its owner
2. Review by the governance layer
3. Human approval
4. A new or amended constitution for the agency
5. A commit to this registry reflecting the change

---

## Authority audit

The authority assignments in this registry are reviewed:
- When a new agency is added
- When an agency's behaviour changes significantly
- At the quarterly evolution review
- When any censor fires and records a violation

All changes to this registry are preserved in Git history.

## Execution boundary

`propose` authority permits an agency to perform bounded internal processing and to write proposal artefacts only within the write targets named in its constitution and the rights registry.

`propose` authority does **not** permit external effects: no merges, no payments, no external disclosures, no governance changes, and no production actions outside those designated proposal/report paths.
