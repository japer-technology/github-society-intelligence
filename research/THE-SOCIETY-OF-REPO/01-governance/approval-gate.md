# Approval Gate

The approval gate is a list of action categories that **always require human approval**, regardless of the authority level of any requesting agency.

No agency in this SOR may bypass the approval gate. The authority-censor enforces this unconditionally.

## How approval is recorded

Human approval is always a **traceable event** in version control:

| Method | When used |
| --- | --- |
| PR merge by owner | Constitutional changes, policy changes, agency changes |
| Issue comment with confirmation text | Payments, data egress, legal commitments |
| Explicit label applied by owner | Routine approvals with lower stakes |

The settlement record for any action requiring approval must include:
- The approval gate category triggered
- The method of approval
- The timestamp of approval
- The identity of the approving human

---

## Censor enforcement

The [authority-censor](../05-censors/authority-censor/README.md) monitors for any attempt to bypass the approval gate.

Any bypass attempt is:
1. Blocked immediately
2. Recorded in the censor's violation log
3. Surfaced to the owner-briefing immediately
4. Never silently swallowed
