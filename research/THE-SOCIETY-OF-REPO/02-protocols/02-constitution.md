# Constitution Protocol

Every durable agency in a Society of Repo must have a constitution.

A constitution is a YAML file that declares what the agency is, what it does, what it must not do, and how it is evaluated.

Without a constitution, a repo is not an agency. It is just a folder.

## Constitution lifecycle

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `active` | Agency is operating normally |
| `probation` | Agency performance is below threshold; under review |
| `retired` | Agency is no longer active; constitution preserved for lineage |

State changes require a PR and owner approval.

---

## Constitution review

Agency constitutions are reviewed:
- When the agency's performance metrics fall below threshold
- When the agency's scope needs to change
- When a new authority level is requested
- At the quarterly evolution review

All reviews produce a commit record in Git history.
