# SOR Example — Personal Assistant

A Society of Repo configured as a personal assistant. The SOR manages tasks, calendar, notes, reminders, research, and daily briefings for an individual. It acts as a durable, governed, local-first cognitive partner that remembers context, reduces mental load, and helps the individual focus on what matters.

## Purpose

This Society of Repo exists to:

```text
1. Track tasks, deadlines, and commitments so nothing important is dropped
2. Monitor the calendar for upcoming events, conflicts, and preparation needs
3. Organise and surface notes, research, and prior context
4. Conduct research and surface relevant information when requested
5. Prepare daily briefings that focus attention on what matters most
6. Build a personal memory that grows more useful over time
7. Reduce cognitive load so the individual can think at a higher level
```

## Scope

```text
In scope:
  - task management: capture, prioritise, track, remind
  - calendar: event monitoring, conflict detection, preparation
  - notes and knowledge: capture, index, retrieval, synthesis
  - research: web search, summarisation, fact retrieval
  - reminders: deadlines, follow-ups, commitments, waiting-on items
  - daily briefing: surface what matters, suppress what does not
  - personal memory: episodic, semantic, procedural, and K-line records

Out of scope:
  - legal advice
  - financial advice or investment decisions
  - medical or clinical decisions
  - decisions that require a licensed professional
  - any commitment made on behalf of the individual without approval
  - autonomous action in external systems without explicit approval

## Memory

### Episodic memory

```text
2026-05-06: Completed Q1 project retrospective. Three action items captured in task-bee.
2026-05-03: Web research on competitor pricing completed. Summary stored in notes-bee.
2026-04-28: Weekly review flagged 4 overdue follow-up items. Owner resolved 3.
2026-04-15: Presentation delivered. Owner noted it went well. K-line reinforced.
```

### Semantic memory

```text
Weekly review: scheduled every Friday morning.
Daily briefing: delivered at 08:00 each weekday.
Projects with deadlines in June: Project A (June 15), Project B (June 30).
Waiting-on items from April: awaiting reply from two external contacts.
```

### Procedural memory

```text
how to prepare for a high-stakes presentation
how to conduct a weekly review
how to structure a project retrospective
how to research a topic and produce a usable summary
how to process an inbox to zero
```

### Failure memory

```text
2026-03: Follow-up item with Contact X was dropped for 6 weeks.
         follow-up-bee did not surface it because it was tagged waiting-on
         without a due date. Procedure updated: all waiting-on items must
         have a maximum wait date.
2026-02: Daily briefing was too noisy. Contained 14 items.
         Owner feedback: limit to 5 most important. Threshold adjusted.
```

```

## Daily briefing format

A governed daily briefing from this SOR contains at most 5 items:

```text
1. Critical deadlines approaching (< 7 days)
2. Today's calendar commitments requiring preparation
3. Overdue tasks
4. Follow-up items past their maximum wait date
5. One piece of useful context (if available)

Everything else is suppressed.
```

The briefing is not a dump of everything open. It is the governed judgement of what deserves attention today.

---

## Non-negotiable limits

```text
1. No personal notes, documents, messages, or task data leave the local system
   without explicit owner approval.
2. No commitment is made on behalf of the individual in any external system
   without explicit approval.
3. No personal identification data or sensitive personal context is sent to
   cloud models without explicit policy authorisation.
4. No credential, API key, or authentication token is shared between agencies
   or sent to any external service.
5. No constitutional change is made without human approval.
6. The daily briefing is never more than 5 items without owner override.
   The SOR exists to reduce cognitive load, not increase it.
```

## Maturity ladder target

| Level | Name | What exists in this SOR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Storage | Notes and task lists in repos |
| 1 | Memory | Structured task, calendar, and note records |
| 2 | Agency | Agencies with roles, constitutions, and outputs |
| **3** | **Society** | **Multiple agencies activate, criticise, settle, and act** |
| **4** | **Learning** | **K-lines reinforce; briefing quality improves over time** |
| 5 | Networked | SOR calls specialist SORs for research or domain tasks |

Start at Level 2. Reach Level 3 within 6 months. Aim for Level 4 at 12 months.

> The personal assistant SOR should grow quieter and smarter over time.
> More reinforced K-lines means better signal, less noise, and a briefing that
> the owner genuinely looks forward to reading.
