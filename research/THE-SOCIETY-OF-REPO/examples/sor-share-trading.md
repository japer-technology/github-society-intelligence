# SOR Example — Share Trading

A Society of Repo configured for an individual share trader. The SOR tracks positions, watchlists, portfolio performance, news, and trading obligations. It helps the individual stay informed and disciplined without outsourcing judgement or bypassing regulated financial advice.

> **Important:** This SOR surfaces information, data, and patterns. It does not give financial or investment advice. Every buy, sell, or hold decision belongs to the individual. Any tax or regulatory matter must be reviewed by a qualified professional.

## Memory

### Episodic memory

```text
2026-04-15: Opened position in XYZ. 500 shares at $4.32. Rationale: earnings rebound thesis.
2026-03-22: Closed position in ABC. 1,000 shares at $11.80. Entry was $9.10. Realised gain noted.
2026-03-05: Ex-dividend date passed for DEF. Dividend of $0.18/share recorded.
2026-02-10: Earnings announcement for GHI. Beat consensus. Position retained per journal entry.
```

### Semantic memory

```text
XYZ: held long. Entry $4.32. Earnings due Q3 2026.
DEF: dividend stock. Pays semi-annually. Next ex-div: approximately September 2026.
Portfolio cash target: minimum 10% at all times per owner preference.
Tax records: cost base tracking method is FIFO per owner instruction.
Brokerage: CommSec. Market: ASX. Hours: 10:00–16:00 AEST.
RBA cash rate decisions: first Tuesday of each month (except January).
```

### Procedural memory

```text
how to record a new trade in the journal
how to calculate unrealised P&L from position records
how to surface all trades in a given financial year for tax record preparation
how to prepare a pre-market briefing from overnight news and corporate actions
how to find the last earnings result for a held security
```

### Failure memory

```text
2025-08: Missed ex-dividend date for DEF. corporate-action-bee did not have the date indexed.
         K-line updated: ex-dividend alert window extended to 14 days prior.
2025-05: Post-trade review for GHI never completed. journal-bee did not surface the pending entry.
         task-bee now creates a mandatory post-trade review task for every closed position.
