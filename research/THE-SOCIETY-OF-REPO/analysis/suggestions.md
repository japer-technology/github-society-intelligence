# Suggestions — what looks missed or under-specified

This repo is strong on vision and structure. The main thing it appears to miss is the bridge between **excellent theory** and **repeatable operation**.

## 1. Add a single “how SOR maps to Forgejo” document

Right now the conceptual model and the deployment model are both present, but the join between them is still implicit.

- `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/README.md` explains agencies, critics, censors, memory, workspace, and services.
- `FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INSTALLATION/transition-plan/08-ai-agent-architecture.md` explains Forgejo repository classes, service accounts, and API-driven agent behaviour.

What still seems missing is one document that says, plainly:

- which SOR concept maps to which Forgejo primitive
- how many repos/orgs you actually expect to create
- what a minimal first deployment looks like
- where settlements, memory, critics, and governance live in the real forge

## 2. Add a true bootstrap / day-one path

You explain the mature ecology well, but not the smallest viable starting point.

- `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/00-foundations/03-maturity-model.md` describes the ladder.
- `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/06-memory/klines/README.md` explains K-lines once they exist.
- `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/10-evolution/README.md` explains reinforcement once outcomes are happening.

What seems absent is:

- the minimum set of repos needed to start
- which agency/critic/censor to create first
- whether first K-lines are hand-written or discovered
- how a fresh instance moves from “docs on disk” to “first governed action”

## 3. Add runnable examples, not just patterns

`FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INSTALLATION/transition-plan/08-ai-agent-architecture.md` gives API examples, but the repo does not yet seem to include starter implementations or live workflow templates. Both `.forgejo/` and `.github/` currently only expose `workflows-disabled/`.

What would help:

- one minimal agent repo example
- one minimal settlement-writing example
- one minimal critic example
- one actual Forgejo Actions workflow template

That would reduce the current “blueprint but not yet kit” feeling.

## 4. Specify runtime protocol, not only schema

The settlement spec is good, but it still reads more like a data model than a full runtime contract.

- `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/02-protocols/05-settlement.md` defines the settlement schema and state flow.
- `FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INSTALLATION/transition-plan/08-ai-agent-architecture.md` shows a four-step agent workflow.

Still missing or not fully explicit:

- how activation is discovered in practice
- how long critics get to respond
- what happens if a critic is offline
- how conflicts between multiple objections are resolved
- what causes a settlement to time out, retry, or fail closed

## 5. Write operational runbooks

The FORGEJO docs are good install guides, but they are lighter on failure handling than on initial setup.

- `FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INSTALLATION/install/09-forgejo.md` covers install and backup creation.
- `FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INSTALLATION/transition-plan/12-security-quotas-and-governance.md` starts disaster recovery and governance controls.
- `FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INSTALLATION/install/06-prometheus-node-exporter.md` covers metrics exposure and basic continuity controls.

What still feels missing:

- forge server recovery runbook
- runner failure / drain / replacement runbook
- certificate failure runbook
- database restore validation runbook
- “what to check first” troubleshooting matrix

## 6. Define upgrade and rollback procedures properly

There is installation guidance, but less explicit maintenance guidance.

Examples:

- Forgejo upgrade / rollback
- runner fleet rolling upgrade sequence
- LM Studio / model upgrade policy
- config migration checks before restart

This matters because the repo aims at a long-lived cognitive infrastructure, not a one-off install.

## 7. Tighten cloud-egress and privacy enforcement from idea to mechanism

The local-first principle is clear, but the actual enforcement path is still under-described.

- `FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INSTALLATION/transition-plan/08-ai-agent-architecture.md` says cloud escalation is policy-controlled.
- `FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INSTALLATION/transition-plan/12-security-quotas-and-governance.md` defines secret scoping and approvals.
- `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/05-censors/` includes cloud-egress, credential, and PII exfiltration censors.

What seems missing is the technical control layer:

- firewall / proxy / allowlist design for outbound model calls
- how prompts are screened before cloud escalation
- how sensitive repos are prevented from ever leaving local inference
- how policy is enforced automatically rather than socially

## 8. Make observability about cognition, not just hosts

`FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INSTALLATION/install/06-prometheus-node-exporter.md` gives host monitoring, which is useful, but the system you describe also needs cognitive observability.

What seems worth adding:

- activation rate by agency
- K-line hit rate
- critic objection frequency
- settlement latency by path
- cloud-escalation frequency and cost
- failure taxonomy for agents

That would make the “society gets better over time” claim measurable.

## 9. Turn reinforcement into an algorithm

`THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/10-evolution/README.md` is directionally right, but still leaves a lot to judgment.

What looks under-specified:

- exact promotion / probation / retirement thresholds
- how reinforcement_count and weakening_count affect routing
- how false positives are measured
- when a K-line is demoted or retired
- when an agency is considered “too noisy”

In short: the repo explains **that** evolution happens, but not yet enough of **how** it is computed.

## 10. Clarify concurrency and shared-state rules

The architecture assumes many agencies and many repos, but the shared workspace behaviour is still a bit abstract.

- `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/README.md` names a global workspace.
- `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/07-workspace/` defines the workspace areas.

Still worth making explicit:

- whether the global workspace is one repo or several
- how concurrent writes are handled
- what locking / merge / retry pattern is expected
- what the source of truth is when workspace and memory disagree

## 11. Add cost accounting as a first-class design concern

You mention local-first, multiple cloud providers, and an economic society, but there is not yet a strong practical cost-control document tying those together.

Especially missing:

- per-task cloud budget rules
- cloud provider selection logic
- storage / backup cost tracking
- inference cost attribution by repo or agency
- monthly governance review thresholds

## 12. Add a contributor / builder onboarding path

There is a lot here for the owner-architect, but less for the next person trying to help build it.

What would help:

- “build your first agency”
- “test an agency locally”
- “connect an agency to memory”
- “promote an experimental agent safely”
- “debug why an activation did not happen”

## Bottom line

The repo does **not** look stupid. It looks unusually thoughtful.

What it most appears to be missing is:

1. **bootstrap guidance**
2. **runnable examples**
3. **runtime protocol details**
4. **operational runbooks**
5. **measurable reinforcement / observability**

If you add those, the project will read much less like a brilliant architecture and much more like a system someone else could reliably stand up, operate, and extend.
