# Research Crosswalk

This appendix maps implemented cognitive mechanisms to their research
origin and current location in the repo.

The three sources cited below are held in full under
[`../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/`](../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/README.md):

- **Minsky 1986** — Marvin Minsky, *The Society of Mind*, Simon &
  Schuster. The full text is at
  [`../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/book/`](../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/book/README.md);
  a thematic companion (overview, principles, architecture, memory,
  frames, conflict, self, deep insights, objections) lives in the
  same folder as `01-overview.md` … `11-objections-and-limits.md`.
- **Minsky 1988** — Marvin Minsky, *ONR Final Report*, reproduced at
  [`../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/research/1988.md`](../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/research/1988.md).
- **2025 Society of Minds** — Mikkilineni & Michaels, *Society of
  Minds: The Architecture of Mindful Machines* (2025), reproduced at
  [`../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/research/2025-10-01.md`](../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/research/2025-10-01.md).

The authoritative term-by-term map and the nine deliberate
divergences (D1–D9) are in
[`../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/12-crosswalk-to-society-of-repo.md`](../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/12-crosswalk-to-society-of-repo.md).
Per-section implementation analyses live beside each book section as
`som-{chapter}.{section}-sor.md` under
[`../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/book/`](../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/book/README.md).

The crosswalk should be updated whenever a major cognitive mechanism
is added, superseded, or relocated. When a new mechanism is added,
the corresponding entry in the upstream crosswalk
([`../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/12-crosswalk-to-society-of-repo.md`](../../THE-SOCIETY-OF-MIND/12-crosswalk-to-society-of-repo.md))
should also be updated in the same change.
