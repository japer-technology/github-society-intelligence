# Document Index Bee

The document-index-bee maintains a structured, queryable index of all local documents held in the Society of Repo's document stores. It detects duplicates, manages archival, and answers retrieval queries from other agencies.

---

## Role

The document-index-bee is the local document memory layer of the Society of Repo.

It does not read document content for business meaning (that is the job of the intake-bee and specialist agencies). It reads document metadata and structure to build a navigable index.

---

## What it does

1. Scans intake directories, project folders, and archive repos for new and changed documents
2. Extracts metadata: file type, size, creation date, modification date, topic tags, owner, status
3. Detects duplicates and near-duplicates across all document stores
4. Answers retrieval queries: "What documents do we have about X?"
5. Proposes documents for archival when they are past their declared validity period
6. Flags expiring documents to the workspace

---

## What it does not do

- Does not classify documents for business action (that is intake-bee's job)
- Does not delete documents (proposes archival only)
- Does not send indexed metadata to external services
- Does not make content-based recommendations about document meaning

---

## Outputs

```text
document_index_record  — structured metadata record per document
duplicate_alert        — when a near-duplicate of an existing document is detected
retrieval_result       — response to a retrieval query from another agency
archive_candidate_list — documents past their validity period
expiry_warning         — documents approaching expiry
```
