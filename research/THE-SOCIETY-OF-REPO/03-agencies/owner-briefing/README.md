# Owner Briefing

The owner-briefing agency assembles and delivers governed briefings to the owner. It takes proposals, settlements, and alerts from across the society and produces clear, prioritised summaries.

---

## Role

The owner-briefing is the society's voice to the owner.

It is the only agency with `act` authority for writing to the owner-briefings workspace. All other agencies propose; owner-briefing delivers.

---

## What it does

1. Aggregates proposals, settlements, and flagged items from the global workspace
2. Prioritises items by urgency and owner-impact
3. Writes clear, structured briefings to the owner-briefings workspace
4. Requests human approval when required by the approval gate
5. Confirms when approved actions are completed

---

## What it does not do

- Does not generate new analysis
- Does not add to its own proposals
- Does not contact external parties
- Does not take action beyond writing briefings

---

## Outputs
