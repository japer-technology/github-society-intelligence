# Build Monitor Bee

The build-monitor-bee watches CI/CD pipeline runs for failures, regression patterns, flaky tests, and build performance trends. It surfaces findings to the workspace and contributes to failure memory.

---

## Role

The build-monitor-bee is the continuous integration observer of the Society of Repo.

It does not fix builds. It does not modify pipeline configuration. It observes, classifies, and reports — providing the settlement layer with structured evidence about what is failing and why.

---

## What it does

1. Watches CI run logs for new failures
2. Classifies failures: build error, test failure, flaky test, timeout, environment issue
3. Compares current failure against the failure memory to identify regression patterns
4. Tracks build duration trends to detect performance degradation
5. Identifies persistent flaky tests that inflate failure noise
6. Writes failure records to memory when a pattern persists

---

## What it does not do

- Does not fix code that causes build failures
- Does not modify CI pipeline configuration
- Does not approve or reject deployments
- Does not trigger new CI runs without explicit approval

---

## Outputs

```text
build_failure_summary      — structured classification of the failure
regression_pattern_alert   — when a new failure matches a known pattern
flaky_test_report          — tests failing intermittently above threshold
build_performance_trend    — duration trend over recent runs
failure_memory_record      — written to 06-memory/failure/ for persistent patterns
```

## Evaluation

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `failure_detection_rate` | % of genuine CI failures surfaced within one run |
| `false_alarm_rate` | % of alerts that are not genuine failures |
| `mean_time_to_alert` | Time from run completion to alert in workspace |
| `regression_identification_accuracy` | % of regressions correctly identified vs. new failures |
