# Section 5.2 — Implementation analysis (SOR / FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION)

**Source section:** [som-5.2.md](som-5.2.md) — *Unanswerable questions*
(Minsky, §5.2).
**Analysis target:** [`FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/)
(plan-of-record for `.forgejo-society/` and
`.forgejo/workflows/forgejo-society.yaml`).

§5.2 makes a startling observation: certain questions cannot be
answered because they are *structurally* circular — every answer
provokes the same question one level up. Mature minds and mature
cultures do not solve these; they close them. The closure is a
discipline, not a truth-claim. The chapter quietly extends this from
philosophy to engineering: a working mind needs ways to stop asking
some questions, or it will spend itself on them.

## The ideas Section 5.2 actually carries

1. **Some questions are circular by construction.** "What caused the
   cause?" and "Why is good good?" have no terminator.
2. **Circular questions waste cognition.** Returning to them yields
   no progress; the loop can only repeat.
3. **Cultures evolve closure mechanisms.** Taboo, mystery, consensus,
   "Just because!" — each makes a class of questions
   undiscussable.
4. **Institutions encode these closures.** Law, religion, philosophy
   indoctrinate populations with specific answers so they are
   spared the loop. The trade is dogma for tractability.
5. **Closure is productive, not cowardly.** Minds lead more
   productive lives "when working on problems that can be solved."
6. **Circular thinking is not always pathology.** When each return
   *deepens* the answer, the loop becomes a spiral and the system
   of ideas may outlive any single mind.
7. **Communicable closures can transcend the individual.** Languages,
   sciences, and philosophies persist because closures travel
   between minds.

## What the implementation already absorbs

### Constitutional closure (ideas 3, 4)

[`07-policies-and-safety.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/07-policies-and-safety.md)
and the SOR mapping in
[`11-mapping-sor-to-implementation.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/11-mapping-sor-to-implementation.md)
treat `governance/constitution.md`, `governance/authority-registry.yml`,
and `governance/self-ideals.md` as material the runtime *reads* but
does not re-litigate. Authority levels are exactly `read`, `draft`,
`propose`, `act`, `govern`, `human` — a closed list. The loop does
not get to reopen the list at runtime.

### Kill switch and approval gate as structural "Just because!" (ideas 3, 5)

The kill switch
([`07-policies-and-safety.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/07-policies-and-safety.md))
and the approval gate
([`02-workflow-design.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/02-workflow-design.md))
close certain questions structurally: "may the society run at all?"
and "may the society write to workflow files?" are not for the loop
to argue. The deliberate phase never sees them as live questions.

### Danger zones as taboo regions (idea 3)

The danger-zone catalogue in
[`07-policies-and-safety.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/07-policies-and-safety.md)
declares regions where the answer is fixed ("require human
confirmation", "require security-agency pass"). These act
operationally like cultural taboos: not absolute refusals, but
brakes on cheap re-entry.

### Honest unknowns (idea 6, partial)

The settlement schema in
[`09-handoff-and-signal-schemas.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/09-handoff-and-signal-schemas.md)
requires `unknowns:` and `blind_spots:` slots, mirroring
`THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/02-protocols/11-introspection.md`. The system
records what it could not close. This is not deepening on return,
but it is the prerequisite for it.

### Communicable closures via committed memory (idea 7)

The append-only `memory/decisions/`
([`08-state-and-memory.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/08-state-and-memory.md))
and the relational links it carries are the operational shape of
"closures that travel" — at least within one society. The federation
material in
[`FORGEJO-SOCIETY-THE-FEDERATION/`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-THE-FEDERATION/)
is the placeholder for travel between societies.

## What the implementation does not yet take into account

### A — No critic detects circular re-litigation

A critic or censor specifically charged with "this question is
already closed by constitution/self-ideals" is not in the first-ship
catalogue
([`05-agencies-critics-censors.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/05-agencies-critics-censors.md)).
The deliberate loop can, in principle, re-raise an authority
question on every cycle; nothing stops it from spending cycles
proving the constitution true.

### B — "Just because!" is structural, not legible

The plan closes some questions, but does not *say* it is closing
them. A settlement does not record "this branch of reasoning was
foreclosed by constitution §X" alongside its `proposals` and
`objections`. The closure is real but invisible to the reader of
the record.

### C — No spiral memory: returns are not tracked as deepening

Idea 6 — that returning to a question can deepen it — has no
representation. K-lines record solved configurations
([`06-frames-polynemes-klines.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/06-frames-polynemes-klines.md));
they do not record "the same open question was approached, more
carefully, in successive settlements." A long-running philosophical
loop across many stimuli looks the same to the runtime as noise.

### D — Reason-loop budget is global, not topical

`max_cycles` and `max_wall_clock_s`
([`05-agencies-critics-censors.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/05-agencies-critics-censors.md))
cap *any* loop. There is no mechanism to recognise that a loop is
specifically a *circular question* (as opposed to a productive
back-and-forth) and to apply the discipline Minsky describes —
adults' "Just because!" — at the right granularity.

### E — Transmission of closures between societies is absent

Idea 7's strongest claim — that closures travel and outlast minds —
is only stubbed.
[`13-inter-repo-communication.md`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/13-inter-repo-communication.md)
and `channels/` are placeholders; the first real channel is
deferred. A successor society cannot today receive an ancestor's
closures as a structured artefact, only as Markdown.

### F — Indoctrination vs. reasoning is not distinguished

Minsky names a real cost: cultures buy tractability with dogma. The
plan inherits constitutional answers by *file*; the loop reads them
the same way it reads any other context. There is no field that
marks a closure as "accepted without reasoning" versus
"established by prior deliberation," so the moral cost Minsky
identifies is not legible in the record either.

## Summary table

| # | Idea | In the plan? | Where / why not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Some questions are circular by construction | Implicit | Authority levels and danger zones encode closures, never re-derive them. |
| 2 | Circular questions waste cognition | Partial | `max_cycles` ([`05`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/05-agencies-critics-censors.md)) caps total cost, not circular cost specifically. |
| 3 | Cultures evolve closure mechanisms | Yes | Kill switch, danger zones, approval gate ([`07`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/07-policies-and-safety.md)). |
| 4 | Institutions encode answers | Yes | `governance/` tree ([`11`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/11-mapping-sor-to-implementation.md)). |
| 5 | Closure is productive | Yes | The plan trusts the constitution; this is the same move. |
| 6 | Circular thinking can spiral and deepen | No | No "spiral" record; K-lines record success, not deepening. |
| 7 | Closures transmit between minds | Stub | Federation/channels are placeholders ([`13`](../../../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-IMPLEMENTATION/13-inter-repo-communication.md)). |

## Implication for the plan (no changes proposed here)

§5.2 reads, against the plan, as a description of a cost the plan
already pays — and a benefit it does not yet collect. The cost is
the dogmatic one: closures are real, they are imported from files,
and the loop is not given a way to know that it is *accepting*
rather than *deriving* an answer. The uncollected benefit is the
spiral: returning to an open question with more material than last
time is the engine of doctrine that outlasts an individual mind, and
the plan currently has no place to record that returning has
happened, let alone that it has deepened.

This file records the gap; it does not propose changes. Per
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) §12, adding new authority levels,
identifier scopes, governance primitives, or new fields on the
load-bearing schemas requires the maintainer's explicit direction.
