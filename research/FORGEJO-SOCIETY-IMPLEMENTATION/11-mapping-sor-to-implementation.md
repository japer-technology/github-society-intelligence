# 11 — Mapping: THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO → Implementation

Every section of `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/` maps to either a path under
`.forgejo-society/` or a step in `.forgejo/workflows/forgejo-society.yaml`.
This is the verification table that enforces the *two-target collapse rule*
from `00-overview.md`.

If any row is missing in the implementation, that capability is not yet
built. If any cognitive concept exists in the running repo without a row
here, the mapping is out of date and must be updated.

## Specification root

`THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/` is used throughout this table as the canonical
*name* of the specification. In this repository it lives at:

- [`FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INTRODUCTION/THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/`](../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INTRODUCTION/THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/)

The repo-native cognitive thesis referenced as `possibility-2.md` lives at:

- [`FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INTRODUCTION/THE-REPO-IS-THE-MIND/possibility-2.md`](../FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INTRODUCTION/THE-REPO-IS-THE-MIND/possibility-2.md)

A SOR file referenced below as `02-protocols/07-service-channel.md` is
therefore the file at
`FORGEJO-SOCIETY-INTRODUCTION/THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/02-protocols/07-service-channel.md`.
Implementation targets named `.forgejo-society/...` are paths that will
exist under the runtime folder once Phase A is committed; today they are
specified by this folder and the bootstrap checklist
([`10-bootstrap-checklist.md`](10-bootstrap-checklist.md)).

## THE-REPO-IS-THE-MIND/possibility-2.md cross-mapping

Concepts from `possibility-2.md` that are not in `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/`:

| possibility-2 concept | Implementation target |
| --- | --- |
| signals as the unit of internal communication | `schemas/signal.schema.json` + `state/.../signals.jsonl` |
| polynemes | `.forgejo-society/nemes/{path,label,phrase}-polynemes.yml` + `symbols.yml` |
| frames as repo-native expectations | `.forgejo-society/frames/*.frame.yml` + `schemas/frame.schema.json` |
| K-lines as reusable mental states | `.forgejo-society/memory/klines/**` + `schemas/kline.schema.json` |
| censors and suppressors as first-class code | `.forgejo-society/censors/*.md` + `policies/danger-zones.yml` + `policy.ts` |
| branches as imagination (≡ branches as candidate futures of reality) | `act` step's `society/<stimulus_id>/candidate-<n>` branch protocol, branch-by-default for every write to `main`; merge into `main` is the reality revision recorded in `settlement.reality_revision` (see `09-handoff-and-signal-schemas.md`) |
| layered blackboard | `state/.../workspace.md` + `blackboard.md` + `signals.jsonl` etc. |
| difference engines | implicit in frame `slots:` (required slots == differences from desired state) |
| direct internal addressing (`society <target>:`) | `nemes/phrase-polynemes.yml` `directive.*` symbols |
| Spock as the conscious bottleneck | `agencies/integration/conscious-presenter.md` is the sole producer of visible response |
| evidence-bearing handoffs (no evidence, no trust) | `schemas/handoff.schema.json` requires `evidence` on every claim |
| mental physics (path → activation, diff → thought, branch → candidate future, merge → reality revision, etc.) | runtime semantics encoded across `nemes/`, `act` step, `state/`, `memory/`, and `settlement.reality_revision` |

## Verification

A reviewer can:

1. Pick any line in `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/` or `possibility-2.md`.
2. Find it in this table.
3. Open the corresponding implementation target.
4. Confirm the capability is either present (Phase A done) or explicitly
   deferred to Phase B/C in `10-bootstrap-checklist.md`.

If a row’s implementation target does not exist and no phase claims it,
the implementation is incomplete.
