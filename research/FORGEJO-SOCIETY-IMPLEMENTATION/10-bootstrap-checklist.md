# 10 — Bootstrap Checklist

The minimum viable Society of Repo. Everything else is optional and can be
added later through `self-modification` settlements once the loop is alive.

This list is intentionally small. The aim is one PR that turns the existing
seed (`.forgejo/workflows/forgejo-society.yaml` + `.forgejo-society/README.md`)
into a working society shell, with the conscious bottleneck wired and the
kill switch effective, even if many agencies and frames are still empty.

Sources: `THE-REPO-IS-THE-MIND/possibility-2.md` *the first commit I would
make*, and `THE-SOCIETY-OF-REPO/00-foundations/10-bootstrap-minimum-viable-sor.md`.

Agents implementing this checklist MUST also follow
`12-agent-implementation-playbook.md`. This checklist says *what* must exist;
the playbook says the safe order and acceptance standard for creating it.

## Phase A — Skeleton (one PR)

### Workflow

- [ ] `.forgejo/workflows/forgejo-society.yaml`
  - [ ] triggers: `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request`, `push`,
        `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`
  - [ ] concurrency group keyed by stimulus
  - [ ] least-privilege `permissions:` at top
  - [ ] one job with named steps for each phase from `02-workflow-design.md`
  - [ ] `guard` step checks `forgejo-society-ENABLED.md` and
        `policies/kill-switch.yml`
  - [ ] `report` step always runs (`if: always()` after `guardrail`) and
        commits `state/` changes

### Mind root files

### Agent completion rules

- [ ] The implementing agent records which checklist items were completed,
      deferred, or blocked by missing external services.
- [ ] Every emitted runtime artifact has either a committed schema or an
      explicit Phase B/C deferral.
- [ ] Every dangerous path in `07-policies-and-safety.md` is represented in
      `policies/danger-zones.yml`.
- [ ] Every agency, critic, and censor manifest validates against
      `schemas/manifest.schema.json`.
- [ ] The workflow has no model prompt, authority decision, or memory rule
      embedded directly in YAML.
- [ ] The workflow can exit successfully before agent code runs when the enable
      sentinel is absent.
- [ ] A reviewer can trace one accepted event from initial stimulus through
      perception, activation, settlement, action, report, and memory paths.

---

## Phase A acceptance checks

A reviewer can:

1. Open an issue with the `activate:intake` label. The workflow runs and
   leaves a comment from Spock that quotes the chosen frame and lists the
   activated agencies. Trace appears under
   `.forgejo-society/state/mind/issues/<n>/`.
2. Open an issue that asks for a workflow change. The workflow runs, the
   `workflow-danger-censor` blocks write tools, the response is a comment
   describing the proposed change without modifying any file.
3. Delete `.forgejo-society/forgejo-society-ENABLED.md` in a PR. After
   merge, no further events trigger any agent activity. The workflow runs
   and exits cleanly at the `guard` step.
4. Open an issue that asks to modify `AGENTS.md`. The settlement records
   `pending_human` and writes an owner briefing. No commit to the soul file
   occurs.
5. Trigger `workflow_dispatch` with the existing `prepare-settlement`
   inputs (`settlement_id`, `source_repo`, `source_ref`, defined at
   `.forgejo/workflows/forgejo-society.yaml` lines 5–14 of the seed
   workflow) from the seed workflow. The new pipeline absorbs them and
   writes a settlement with `outcome=success`.

If any of those five fail, Phase A is not complete.

## Phase B — Real cognition (subsequent PRs)

Each item is its own PR, gated by the `self-modification` frame:

- [ ] add the remaining frames (`bug`, `feature`, `self-modification`,
      `novel`)
- [ ] add the remaining agencies from `05-agencies-critics-censors.md`
- [ ] add the remaining critics and censors
- [ ] enable K-line writing in the `archivist` after first successful
      settlements
- [ ] enable analogy fallback once `memory/analogies/` has at least one entry
- [ ] enable scheduled cron pass (decay, ecology review)
- [ ] tighten the `direct_commit_allowed:` exception list in
      `policies/write-policy.yml` based on observed Phase A traffic
      (the default `branch_and_settle` for every write to `main` is
      already enabled in Phase A; this item only reviews the exception
      list)
- [ ] add the assembly tier when traffic justifies summarisation
- [ ] add the meta-admin family

---

## Phase C — Inter-society (deferred)

- [ ] flesh out `services/` and `channels/`
- [ ] write the first reciprocal channel agreement
- [ ] register the society as a service to one external SOR

These are explicitly deferred per `00-overview.md` *out of scope here*.

---

## Deferred items (acknowledged but not in any phase yet)

- Choice of LLM provider, model, and exact SDK
- Specific egress allowlist
- Public-fabric publishing
- Migration tooling for `state/` schema bumps

Each becomes its own settlement when needed.
